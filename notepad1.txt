Reusable Actions:  can be used in other Tests. They can be used in the same Test Script multiple times.
Non-Reusable Actions: can not be used in other Tests. They can be called in the same script only once.

if an action becomes big, its a nice practise to split it. You can split an existing action in two ways

  Independent of each other which splits the selected action into two sibling actions
  Nested Action which splits the selected action into a parent action whose last step calls the second, child action.

Action can access test data stored in datasheets. QTP provide 2 type of datasheets
1.GLOBAL Datasheet- It is unique for entire test.  Action can access and write data into Global Datasheet. sheet is GLOBAL.
2.LOCAL Datasheet- Equal to number of Actions in the sheet. Action can read and write data into its own local datasheet.
sheet name = "ACTION NAME"

Purpose of creating Actions is used in other Test Scripts.
1.Call to COPY of an Action
2.Call to an Existing Action

Error message can be stored and retreived in Output value.
2.LOCAL Datasheet-
